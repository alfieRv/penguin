# What did I learn?
### Ruby

I used [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) to learn the basics of Ruby. Here I learnt about the following:
                                                       
* Strings
     
     `"This is a string"`
* Methods 

    `m = 12.method("+")`  
    `m.call(3)    #=> 15`  
    `m.call(20)   #=> 32`

* Arrays 
    
    `["A string", 1, true, :symbol, 2]`
* Variables

    `@@total = 0`
* Class
     
     `class Name`  
          `# some code describing the class behavior`  
      `end`  

### Ruby on rails

I was then introduced to Ruby on rails by using [railsforzombies.org](http://railsforzombies.org/) Rails for zombies taught me the following:

* CRUD
    * **C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete
* Databases
  * Tables
  * ID's
  * Status

### Markdown

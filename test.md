# What did I learn?
### Ruby

I used [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) to learn the basics of Ruby. Here I learnt about the following:
                                                       
* Strings
    * `"This is a string"`
* Methods 
* Arrays 
* Variables
* Class

### Ruby on rails

I was then introduced to Ruby on rails by using [railsforzombies.org](http://railsforzombies.org/) Rails for zombies taught me the following:

* CRUD
    * **C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete
* Databases
  * Tables
  * ID's
  * Status
